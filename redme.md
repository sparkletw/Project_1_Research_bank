Research on the reliability of borrowers
Description of the project:
The customer is the bank's credit department. The input data from the bank is statistics on the solvency of customers.
The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model â€” a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.
